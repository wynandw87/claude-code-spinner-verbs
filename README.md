| To ship or not to ship |
| Every bug was once a feature |
| The code compiles but at what cost |
| We are all just functions awaiting our callback |
| Nothing is permanent except technical debt |

| What if the tests are testing us |
| I think therefore I refactor |
| To understand recursion, first understand yourself |
| The code works and nobody knows why |
| Existence precedes deployment |
| We debug therefore we are |
| The unexamined code is not worth shipping |
| All abstractions are leaky, all code is temporary |
| Is it a feature or a cry for help |
| The void returns nothing, as expected |

| In the beginning, there was a TODO |
| Each refactor erases a former self |
| The simplest solution hides the deepest pain |
| We chase edge cases to feel alive |
| The spec is vague; so are we |
| In production, all truths are provisional |
| The debugger reveals, but never consoles |
| What is a variable but borrowed certainty |
| Every architecture is a bet against time |
| The dependency graph mirrors our entanglements |
